FREE CLINIC PROJECT

ANDROID SUBPROJECT    -  org.freeclinic.android.*
-----------------------------------------------
To Run The Free Clinic Activity Device:

1) Select the freeclinic icon from the programs list
2) Login using your username and password
   Competition Note: The demonstration login information is:
   username: demo
   password: xxxx
3) From the list of checked in patients, select a patient to view info on. If no patients have been checked
   in using the web service, there will be no patients in the list.
4) Once a patient has been selected, the following options are available:

COLLECT VITALS
This allows for the manual entry of measurements into the database. Once saved, the measurements will be sent
back to the service.

PATIENT HISTORY
Displays the past information on a patient from the database. This include their past diagnosesis, treatements,
perscriptions, labs and referals. The results can be filtered using the filter buttons on the top of the 
screen or ordered using the "order by" buttons.

VISUALIZE
This screen will show a graphical representation of the collected vitals.

ALLERGIES
Displays a list of the allergies that the patient has. An input is provided to add new allergies to the 
patients records.

PERSCRIBE
Allows the doctor to make a remote perscription request for the patient. At present, the system is set
up to automatically send the information to an onsite pharmacy, but it is hoped that this will eventually
allow the doctors to send requests automatically to an off site pharmacy associated with the patient.

DIAGNOSE
This allows for the diagnosis of a patient during an exam. Autocomplete is utilized for consistency of spelling
and to avoid data entry errors. 

TREATMENT
Allows the doctor to add the record of a patient treatment to the patient's history.

REFER
Makes a referal note in the patient's history. In the future, this will be linked into an autocomplete
of asscociated doctors and will send automatic notifications to them.

DETAILS
Displays the demographic information on a patient.

NOTE
Allows the doctor to enter a general note about the patient.

EXIT
Returns to the check-in screen
